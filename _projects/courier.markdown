		<h4>Project Deliverable</h4>
		<p>New corporate website for Courier publishing company</p>
		<h4>Project overview</h4>
		<p>A newly redesigned corporate website, courier.com, was launched within two months. As their web developer, I worked in a small team comprised of designers, writers, and project managers. One of the client's requirements was to build this project on Expression Engine framework. I took a course about EE and also, in a joint effort with the writer, wrote a detailed documentation for courier's internal employees .  The website was requested to have browser support in the following: IE 7+, Firefox, Chrome, Safari. Design has fixed width layout and targets desktop/laptop users. Design templates were provided.</p>
