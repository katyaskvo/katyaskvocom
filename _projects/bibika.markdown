project_overview: "This project had to be simple and informative. I added a slideshow with game's screenshots to give more idea about this project. Designed a logo as license plate, because it very well describes the app's theme. Draw creators portraits to add more personal feel. I chosen pink and yellow as a theme colors for the website, because both of them used in the app and give very uplifting mood :)"
