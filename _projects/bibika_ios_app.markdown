project_deliverable: "Interactive sound book iOS app for little kids."

project_overview: "This is my first iOS app. The idea I come up with had driven me to learn iOS development, vector graphics and animation with the help of my amazing collaborator Masha Tyomkina (http://urbanabsurd.com). The project is very simple, but challenging for us, since we had to learn from scratch the technologies to make real. This app is iPad only and is available on iTunes store"
