	<p>My name is Katya. Iâ€™m a self-taught web developer. I am originally from Novosibirsk, Russia. During college, I studied fashion design. It was dream of mine, since childhood, to pursue a career in fashion. While studying fashion design, I got very discouraged with the fashion industry and its detachment from the real world. I found myself lost. I still had passion for designing, but I wanted my ideas and aspirations to serve real purpose. After much contemplation, I started experimenting with web design and creating web pages. I instantly fell in love with the process. It combined everything I was looking for where I was able to learn by myself, explore and push limits of my own creativity, and make something that serves real purpose. All I needed was a computer, internet connection, and a desire to make something beautiful. That life changing moment happened in 2009. Since then, I felt truly happy because I finally found my true calling. Every day I learn something new about web development and aesthetics of design. All these years, I felt like I was on an endless creative adventure. I had picked up many technical skills and had a chance to work with awesome people around the world. I really love the creative community in which we all share knowledge and ideas to achieve great individual or collaborative goals. It is truly amazing.</p>

	<p>I am very happy with my choice. I can see the beauty of things on a different level now and it makes me feel good. Fashion is now a hobby and when time allows, I still create my own clothes. (<a href="http://kotikey.com">kotikey.com</a>).</p>
